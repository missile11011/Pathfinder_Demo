## About
The reason for me building this application was to understand algorithms and to visualize how they work. This application is to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. To use just set a start and finish point with the buttons. Next place obstacles like walls and just press run to find the shortest path.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
